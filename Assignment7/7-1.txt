Questions 1

A:
There are 4 reads given. The outer loop runs 16 times and the inner loop runs 16 times.
4 * 16 * 16 = 1024 is the number of reads.

B:
Every time you enter the first loop, the entire struct is read 16 times. A miss occurs 
every second struct read. Therefore, the cache will miss 16 * (16/2) = 128

C:
The miss rate is the number of misses divided by number of reads.
128/1024 = 0.125 which is 12.5%
